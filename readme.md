# Hannah's Sidekey Ferris Sweep Layout

This is an evolution of the first 34-key layout I designed for my Ferris Sweep.
I have tried to place layer keys in various positions and I have come to the
conclusion that - for me at least - thumb keys are too important to use for
layer switching or overloading to be used in multiple ways.

Instead I have overloaded two keys at the lower left- and right-sides of the
keyboard, freeing up the thumb keys to provide `Shift`, `Space`, `Enter` and
`Escape`. Tapping the `Left` key enters a **left tap** layer for a single
keypress whereas holding down the `Left` key enters a **left hold** layer until
the key is released. The `Right` key accesses the **right tap** and **right
hold** layers in the same way.

Double-tapping the layer keys accesses the keypress that the layer key
overloaded. So double-tapping `Left` produces a `Z` and double-tapping `Right`
produces `/`.

That sounds like a lot of functionality but for the most part it flows nicely.
The commonly used keypresses are on the right layers: mostly you will be
right-tapping for punctuation and right-holding for numbers, with a bit of
left-holding for navigation.

### Credit

Once again, I want to give credit and a massive amount of thanks to [Ben
Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/benvallack) for talking through his
tap-not-hold approach and for all of his inspirational work on ergonomic
keyboards and layouts. My initial layout drew heavily from his [Ferris Sweep
layout](https://github.com/benvallack/34-QMK-Ferris-Sweep).

The contributers who make QMK possible are an incredible bunch of people and the
ErgoMechKeyboard community as a whole has been welcoming and helpful. Please
support open source projects and communities.
